# 👋 Hi, I'm Kostas

I'm a physicist-turned-software engineer with a passion for building intelligent, reliable systems in the fields of **autonomous vehicles** and **data-driven simulation**.

🔧 Currently working on **scenario-based testing** and **simulation tooling** for autonomous driving systems  
🧠 PhD in Theoretical Physics – strong background in **statistical modeling**, **optimization**, and **Python-based data analysis**  
🚗 Experience with **V&V of L4 autonomous trucks**, including automated scenario generation, performance KPIs, and simulation-debugging pipelines

👀 Currently exploring:
- Lane detection in simulated environments (Carla)
- Applying ML and CV techniques to improve simulation realism and perception robustness

## 🌱 I’m interested in...
- Autonomous driving systems (V&V, perception, behavior modeling)
- Scenario generation and validation for ADAS/AD
- Applying AI in safety-critical systems
- Anything Physics related
